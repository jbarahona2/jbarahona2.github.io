  <h3>-Sooooo first thing is first,hello amaizing people I hope you are doing amazing today. I am going to be giving you tips on how to paint.First, make sure you are in a quiet place so you can relax. Also a way you can think of something to paint is to just think of the things you love. The most important thing is that you are away from work, school, noise, siblings, etc.</h3>
  <p>-Sometimes I myself get confused on which brush to use, so something  I do is just USE ANY BRUSH!!! Because this is your spacial time do whatever you want. If you do want to know the names of the brushes and what they do I put a link to a video down bellow.</p>
